Run a short smoke test of a Csound .csd file to detect runtime crashes or hangs.

Executes the .csd file for a brief duration (default 1 second) to verify it runs without crashing. This catches issues that pass compilation but fail at runtime (e.g., division by zero, invalid table access, infinite loops).

Use this after successful compilation to validate runtime behavior.

Parameters:
- filePath: Absolute path to the .csd file
- durationSeconds: How long to run (default 1.0, max 5.0)

Returns exit_code, stdout, stderr from the short run.
