Compile a Csound .csd file and return structured diagnostics.

Runs `csound` in syntax-check mode (no audio output) to validate the file. Returns structured error/warning diagnostics with line numbers, severity, and messages.

Use this tool after generating or patching a .csd file to verify it compiles correctly. If compilation fails, examine the diagnostics to understand what needs fixing.

Parameters:
- filePath: Absolute path to the .csd file to compile

Returns structured output with:
- exit_code: 0 for success, non-zero for failure
- diagnostics: Array of {severity, line, col, message, opcode} objects
- stdout/stderr: Raw compiler output
