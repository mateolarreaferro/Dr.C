Parse Csound compiler stderr output into structured diagnostics.

Takes raw stderr text from a Csound compilation and returns an array of structured diagnostic objects. This is a pure text processing tool — no subprocess is spawned.

Use this when you have raw Csound error output and need to extract specific error locations and messages.

Parameters:
- stderr: Raw stderr output from a Csound compilation

Returns an array of diagnostics, each with: severity, line, col, message, opcode.
